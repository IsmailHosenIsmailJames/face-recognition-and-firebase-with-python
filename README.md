# face-recognition-and-firebase-with-python
Aslamu alicum.

I have build 5 python script that for different functionality. The functionality are :

1| Presentation system using face landmark (main)
2| Download profile photo from Firebase server to the local storage and decode face landmark and store them for use later.
3| if got any unexpected profile photo that have multiple face or no face, sent a report to the profile so that the user upload photo again.
4| We can use multiple cameras under one computer in one script.
5| It can handle multiple classrooms in the same time.

Also I have build an App , the work flow of this App is pretty simple. The students and the parents (guardians) both can create their account. The user will upload profile photo and all required information when they creating account.

More features will in process and developed after the Examination.

I just need some motivation.
